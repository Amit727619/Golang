Correctness (4/5):

    The implementation appears to be correct for the most part.
    However, there's a missing base case for an empty array in the mergeSort function. You should add a check at the beginning to return the array if its length is less than or equal to 1.

go

    if len(arr) <= 1 {
        return arr
    }

    Complexity (4/5):
        The time complexity of your Merge Sort implementation is O(n log n), where n is the size of the array.
        However, keep in mind that Go's append operation may result in occasional reallocations, which can impact performance. You might consider pre-allocating slices to improve efficiency.

    Test Cases (3/5):
        Your test case is relatively small (only four elements). Consider adding more diverse test cases, such as arrays with even and odd lengths, arrays with repeated elements, and larger arrays, to ensure the correctness and robustness of your implementation.

    Workflow (4/5):
        The workflow of the program is clear, with separate functions for mergeSort and merge.
        The print statements within the merge function are helpful for understanding how the merging process works. However, consider using proper logging or comment out the print statements in the final version of your code.

Overall, your implementation is good, but addressing the points mentioned above will improve the correctness and reliability of your program. Additionally, expanding your test cases will help ensure the robustness of your implementation across different scenarios.
